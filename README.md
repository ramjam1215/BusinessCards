Issues:
- So i downloaded the the semantic files and added them in sort of manually in the angular.json file. I placed it in the scripts and styles arrays. i got an error on the webpage about jquery not being defined, i believe.
- I had to also place jquery BEFORE the semantics.css in the scripts array. It worked, and thats where i'm going to stop

node-package-manager
installed jquery --save... i think thats technically there already 
installed semantics-ui-css --save
installed firebase @angular/fire --save
installed rxjs --save
